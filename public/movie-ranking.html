<h1>My favoirate MCU movies at all time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 recommendation with 3 reasoning</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Captain America Winter Soldier</h3>
<p>
Great twist at the end.<br />
Action is amazing.<br />
Funny jokes are there.<br />
</p>

<h3>2. Iron Man</h3>
<p>
The first MCU movie.<br />
Great opening to an epic saga.<br />
Amazing ending to line up to the Avengers.<br />
</p>

<h3>3. Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>
Great end to the Saga.<br />
Having all of the characters to fight Thanos.<br />
Long movie but so much in it, it feels so short.<br />
